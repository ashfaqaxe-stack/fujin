# Fujin: data-table plan

_Created 2026-09-21. Full spec for the Phase 2 flagship (`docs/plan.md` §7).
Decisions below came out of a requirements session; each row says what was
picked and why, so this file can be revisited without re-litigating it._

## 1. Goal

Ship a data-table composite that matches the two reference systems the brief
named:

- **Shopify admin (Polaris `IndexTable` + `IndexFilters`)** — a single search
  bar that behaves like a combobox: typing suggests filterable columns,
  picking one turns into a pill with its own value picker (multi-select),
  free text left over becomes a plain search query; selecting rows swaps the
  header for a bulk-action bar at the same height; header and action bar
  stick to the viewport on scroll.
- **GitHub (Projects table view / Issues list)** — same search-and-select
  behaviour, plus clicking a column header opens a popover of that column's
  unique values for a quick per-column filter.

The brief's requirement is that both entry points (search bar, header click)
feed **one shared filter state**, not two parallel systems.

## 2. Decisions

| # | Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sequencing against missing Phase 1 primitives | Build only the ~9 primitives data-table needs, then data-table | Only `spinner`/`button`/`input`/`field` exist. Building the full Phase 1 list first would delay the flagship for no benefit; building throwaway local pieces risks rework when the real primitives land |
| 2 | Data-fetching model | Server-driven by default (`mode: "server"`), with a client-only escape hatch (`mode: "client"`) | Matches how Shopify/GitHub actually scale; TanStack Table's `manualSorting/Filtering/Pagination` map directly onto this |
| 3 | Filter entry points | Unified — header-click and search-bar picks write the same filter state, rendered as the same pills | One mental model; avoids "two places to check what's filtered" |
| 4 | Bulk selection scope | Full cross-page selection with a "select all N matching" banner | Required for the selection descriptor to mean anything once data is server-paginated |
| 5 | Column feature scope for v1 | Visibility only (dropdown-menu show/hide). Pinning, resizing, reordering, grouping deferred | Keeps v1 buildable; each deferred feature has its own WCAG 2.5.7 (no drag-only) and API design work that shouldn't block the core table |
| 6 | Saved views / tabs | Out of scope for v1 | Not in the original brief; filter-state shape must not preclude adding it later, but nothing is built now |
| 7 | CSV export | Included in v1 | Small addition once the selection descriptor and bulk-action bar exist |
| 8 | Filter value types | Text / single-select / multi-select from unique values, date range, numeric range, boolean | Covers every filter type both reference systems actually use |
| 9 | Sticky header | Sticky to the **viewport**, offset configurable (`stickyOffset` prop / CSS var), not just the table's internal scroll container | This is the specific behaviour called out from Shopify — header and action bar stay visible while the page scrolls, not just while the table scrolls |
| 10 | Bulk-action inline count | Fixed at 2 inline actions, rest in a "⋯" overflow menu | Matches Shopify's density; no configurable prop since there's no requirement driving one |
| 11 | Virtualization | Opt-in (`virtualized` prop), off by default | Keeps DOM simple/inspectable for typical admin-table row counts; avoids virtualization's sticky-header/find-in-page interaction complexity until actually needed |
| 12 | Next.js vs React split | One framework-agnostic `data-table` (`frameworks: ["react", "next"]`); data-fetching glue (Server Action vs TanStack Query) lives only in `examples/`, not as a second registry item | The component itself has no server dependency; only the demo of wiring it up differs per framework |

## 3. Prerequisite primitives

None of these exist yet. Each ships as a real `registry:ui` item — full
`meta.fujin`, an example, a docs page, WCAG 2.2 AA pass — before data-table
starts. Build order matters: `table` and `checkbox` first (data-table's
skeleton needs them immediately), `command` next (it's the biggest lift —
wraps `@base-ui/react/autocomplete` for the search-bar combobox), the rest in
any order.

| Primitive | Base UI part | Why data-table needs it |
|---|---|---|
| `table` | none (semantic HTML) | `Table`, `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, `TableHead`, `TableCell` — the raw parts data-table's markup composes |
| `checkbox` | `@base-ui/react/checkbox` | Row selection, multi-select filter value lists |
| `popover` | `@base-ui/react/popover` | Filter value pickers, per-column header filter popover |
| `command` | `@base-ui/react/autocomplete` | The search-bar combobox: type-ahead column picker → value picker, keyboard nav |
| `dropdown-menu` | `@base-ui/react/menu` | Column visibility toggle, bulk-action overflow, per-row action menu |
| `badge` | none (styled span) | Filter pills, selection count |
| `tooltip` | `@base-ui/react/tooltip` | Icon-only header buttons (sort, overflow) |
| `separator` | `@base-ui/react/separator` | Toolbar dividers |
| `skeleton` | none (styled div) | Loading-state rows |

Page-size selection reuses `dropdown-menu` rather than adding a `select`
primitive — no need to pull that in for one control.

## 4. Architecture

Per `AGENTS.md`: behaviour in `lib/`, no classNames; markup in `components/`,
no business logic.

```txt
registry/fujin/lib/data-table/
  use-data-table.ts            sorting, column visibility, pagination, orchestrates the others
  use-data-table-filters.ts    filter pills, search-bar parsing, unique-value fetching contract
  use-data-table-selection.ts  cross-page selection descriptor (include/exclude sets)
  use-data-table-url-state.ts  nuqs binding for sort/filters/pagination/search
  csv-export.ts                row -> CSV serialization + client-mode download trigger
  types.ts                     DataTableColumnMeta, FilterDef, SelectionDescriptor, etc.

registry/fujin/components/data-table/
  data-table.tsx                    root: composes toolbar + table + pagination, owns sticky offset
  data-table-toolbar.tsx            search bar + rendered pills
  data-table-filter-combobox.tsx    Command-based: pick column -> pick values
  data-table-filter-pill.tsx        one active filter, editable/removable
  data-table-column-header.tsx      sortable header button (aria-sort) + filter-popover trigger
  data-table-column-filter-popover.tsx  GitHub-style unique-values popover per header
  data-table-column-visibility-menu.tsx dropdown-menu show/hide
  data-table-selection-bar.tsx      replaces header row on selection; 2 inline actions + overflow
  data-table-pagination.tsx
  data-table-empty-state.tsx / -loading.tsx / -error.tsx
```

### Selection descriptor

```ts
type SelectionDescriptor =
  | { type: "include"; ids: string[] }
  | { type: "exclude"; ids: string[]; total: number }
```

Selecting everything on the current page and choosing "select all N" flips to
`exclude` with the rows the user then deselects added to `ids`. Bulk actions
and CSV export both take this shape instead of a plain id array, so they stay
correct at any page size.

### Data-fetching contract

```ts
useDataTable({
  data, columns,
  mode: "server" | "client",   // default "server"
  rowCount,                    // required in server mode
  sorting, onSortingChange,
  filters, onFiltersChange,
  pagination, onPaginationChange,
  search, onSearchChange,
})
```

In `"server"` mode these map to TanStack Table's `manualSorting: true` /
`manualFiltering: true` / `manualPagination: true`, and the app wires the
`onXChange` callbacks to its own fetch (Server Action, route handler, React
Query — whichever). In `"client"` mode the hook flips those flags off and
TanStack Table computes everything from the full in-memory `data` array.

### Filter model

Each column opts in via `meta.filter`:

```ts
meta: {
  label: "Status",
  filter: {
    type: "select" | "multi-select" | "text" | "date-range" | "number-range" | "boolean",
    getOptions?: (query?: string) => Promise<FilterOption[]> | FilterOption[],
  }
}
```

`getOptions` is how both entry points get the same list: the search-bar
combobox and the header-click popover both call it. Free text typed into the
search bar that doesn't match a column label becomes a plain `search` token
(global search), not a pill — matching the brief's "if you type the entire
thing like search then search can be applied."

State synced to the URL via `nuqs`: `sort`, `filters` (JSON param), `q`
(search text), `page`, `pageSize`. Selection and column visibility stay in
component state only — too volatile/large for a shareable URL; column
visibility gets an optional `persistKey` (localStorage) later if wanted, not
in v1.

### Sticky header

`<DataTable stickyOffset={64}>` sets a CSS var
(`--fujin-data-table-offset`) that the toolbar, column-header row and
selection bar all use for `top-[var(--fujin-data-table-offset)]` plus
`scroll-margin-top` at the same value, per the WCAG 2.4.11 (Focus Not
Obscured) note already in `docs/plan.md` §2.

## 5. Non-goals for v1

Column pinning, resizing, reordering, grouping; saved views/tabs; row
virtualization on by default. Each is a real follow-up item, not cut for
good — the filter/selection/URL-state shapes above are picked so none of
them require a breaking change later.

## 6. Verification (per `AGENTS.md`)

```bash
pnpm --filter www registry:build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm --filter www build
```

Plus, once components render: Vitest + axe per new primitive and for
data-table itself, a Playwright pass over the docs preview, and — since this
affects templates — `pnpm --filter www dev`, `pnpm templates:sync`, then
build both `templates/next` and `templates/react`.

## 7. Suggested build order

1. `table`, `checkbox` (data-table's skeleton needs these immediately)
2. `command` (biggest lift — the search-bar combobox depends on it)
3. `popover`, `dropdown-menu`, `badge`, `tooltip`, `separator`, `skeleton`
4. `data-table` headless hooks (`lib/data-table/`)
5. `data-table` markup (`components/data-table/`), wired to the hooks
6. Examples: a client-mode Vite demo, a server-mode Next.js demo (Server
   Action + `nuqs` in a Server Component), docs page
7. Axe + Playwright passes, template sync, both template builds
